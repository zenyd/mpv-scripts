## speed-transition
This is a lua script for the mpv media player. The purpose of this script is to speed up the video if no subtitles are visible for a certain amount of (user configurable) time. It is inspired by the [speed-between-subs](https://gist.github.com/bitingsock/47c5ba6466c63c68bcf991dd376f1d18) script.

### How it works
The script looks for the next subtitle and if it is ahead by 5 (default) seconds the video gets sped up and resumes normal playback just before the subtitle becomes visible. This is done to prevent audio glitches when speech starts.

### Usage
For the script to work it is necessary to have an appropriate 'text' subtitle selected and visible.

The script works best in `video-sync=audio` mode (the default in mpv), because it will then be able to minimize frame drops on speed transition from high->normal. Stutter-free playback is the result.

Sensible defaults have been set, but if you want to change the `lookahead` value take care to not set it larger than what the buffers can provide. This applies to embedded subtitles and not external.

**skipmode:**
There is an alternative speedup mode called 'skipmode'. In this mode the video doesn't speed up, but it gets skipped till the next subtitle. It can be configured to skip directly to the next subtitle or in steps. To enable skipmode set `skipmode = true` and to enable direct skip set `directskip = true`.

Key Bind|Effect
--------|------
`ctrl + j`|Toggle script on/off
`ctrl + alt+ j`|Toggle skip mode
`alt + j`|Toggle sub visibility on/off (non-styled subs)
`alt + '+'`|Increase speedup
`alt + '-'`|Decrease speedup
`alt + '0'`|Increase leadin (time before the next subtitle to return to normal speed)
`alt + '9'`|Decrease leadin
`alt + '8'`|Increase Look ahead (if the next subtitle is closer than this, don't speed up)
`alt + '7'`|Decrease Look ahead


## subselect
A lua script for downloading subtitles using a GUI and automatically loading them in mpv. It lets you input the name of the video but mainly tries to guess it based on the video title. Uses subliminal for subtitle download and Python tkinter for GUI. Works both on Windows and Linux (possibly macOS too?).

Right now it only lists subtitles from OpenSubtitles, but has the ability to search for the best subtitle which searches all subtitle providers.

### Prerequisits
1. Install Python 3
2. Make sure Python is in your PATH
3. Linux: Depending on the used distribution installation of `pip` and `tk` may be necessary
3. Install subliminal:  `python -m pip install subliminal` should do the trick

### Installation
Copy the `subselect` folder containing `main.lua` and `subselect.py` into your script folder. If you have previous installations of subselect where it was not inside the subselect sub folder, remove them.

### Configuration
Changing the configuration is optional. Options:
* *down_dir*: set the download path for the subtitles
* *sub_language*: set language for subtitles [default english]; value is a 3-letter ISO-639-3 language code

Per default the script tries to download the subtitles into the folder from where the video is being played. If that's not possible, it downloads them into your HOME folder, or in Windows, into your Downloads folder. You may have to set the subselect.py path manually if the script guesses the wrong mpv configuration directory. If the script is somehow not working as expected, it is recommended to set *down_dir* and make sure it's an absolute path and does exist.

The option to be changed can be put inside a `subselect.conf` file in the `script-opts` folder. Create them if they don't exist.
Sample `subselect.conf` if you want to change all options:
```
down_dir=C:\Users\<me>\subtitles
sub_language=deu
```

### Usage
First invoke the script using `alt + u`, input a movie name, or use the one provided by the script, search and download subtitles. If you want to change the language for the subtitles append `;[3-letter ISO-639-3 code]`. So if you want to search for e.g. german subtitles append `;deu`.


## delete-file
As the name suggests this is a small script for deleting files played through mpv. You can mark a file to be deleted and can unmark it if desired. Once quitting mpv, the script starts the deletion process. This is platform-agnostic so should work everywhere.

Key Bind|Effect
--------|------
`ctrl + DEL`|mark/unmark file to be deleted
`alt + DEL`|show the list of files marked for deletion
`ctrl + shift + DEL`|clear the list of marked files

The script can be configured to move files instead of deleting them. The default folder for the moved files is `C:\Users\<me>\delete_file`. To change the defaults create a `delete_file.conf` inside of the `script-opts` folder with contents:
```
MoveToFolder=yes
```

## copy-paste-URL
Like its name suggests - copy and paste links into mpv with `ctrl + v` to start playback of a video. This needs an open mpv window like `mpv --idle --force-window` or a window already playing a video. Also the script utilizes powershell, so that needs to be installed as well.


## censor
Skip over parts of videos you don't want (others) to view.

  ##download and installation

   download only "censor" folder and its contents.
   put the "censor" folder(along with files in it i.e "names" folder and "main.lua") in the "scripts" folder inside mpv configuration folder.
  
**Usage:**
imagine you want to skip the intro which begins on timestamp 0:2:30 and lasts until timestamp 0:4:00
your anime is called Attack on Titan - 03.mkv.
So you create a text file named Attack on Titan - 03.txt inside the names folder.
Now open the just created file and paste 0:02:30 0:04:00 inside it. Save and exit.
If you open the anime Attack on Titan - 03.mkv it should now skip to the timestamp 0:04:00 after the playtime reaches 0:02:30.
If you now also wanted to skip the ending you would add one more line to the text file with contents like this 0:21:00 0:22:00
